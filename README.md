## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS components
- CSS Flex Box
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

- File based Routing: Defining pages and routes with files and folders instead of code. Less code, less work, highly understandable

- Server side Rendering: Automatic page prerendering which is great for SEO and initial load. Being able to blend client side and server side rendering by fetching data on the server and render finished pages to the browser

- Fullstack Capabilities: Easily add backend (server side) code to your Next/React apps with API Routes. Storing data, getting data authentication etc. can be added to our React projects
